## Introduction
  There is much anecdotal evidence supporting the notion that bright headlights are a significant concern and  bother for many drivers [@AAA]. New headlights are perceived as brighter due to their color and because they are LEDs. While we don't have exact timelines for the deployment of new headlights, 2007 marks the first year cars were available with these headlights, though it was only higher-end cars. As time has passed, LED headlights are now available in most new cars sold [@RD]. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that about 75% of cars sold in 2023 had LED headlights  [@AAA].
  
  Most research now, especially that which draws off findings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety(IIHS), states that these new headlights are in fact safer and that glare from these headlights hasn't yet been linked to increases in nighttime car crashes [@AAA_2]. 
  
  It is still recognized that bright headlights are a distraction.One amendment that has been approved for deployment in the USA is Adaptive Driving Beam Headlights, which will turn off various LEDs in the headlight array to reduce glare while still keeping the high visibility [@GLF]. While this was approved in 2022, ADB hasn't been implemented in the US due to compliance challenges car manufacturers face [@AAA].
  
  In the meantime, more and more cars on the road have brighter headlights. Considering the high volume of anecdotal reports that these are distracting and often cause "near misses", as well as the scarce research into the potential connection between increasing perceived brightness of headlights and nighttime car accidents, this research paper seeks to use linear regression to explore if there is a connection between time and accidents caused by headlight glare.
  
  Our research will be focused on California, using data obtained from the California Highway Patrol's California Crash Reporting System. Due to the size of that data, we will be limiting our study to accidents that were recorded to have occured in poor lighting that would legally require headlights to be on.
  
  In @sec-prev, we'll discuss a study done by the IIHS that seeks to explore the same topic. In @sec-data, we'll cover the data we used, as well as steps taken to use it for our analysis. @sec-methods introduces the final model, while @sec-other introduces an alternate we considered and why it wasn't pursued. @sec-results introduces the results of our analysis, and @sec-discussion presents the implications of these results, and other limiting factors that may be of consideration.

## Previous Literature {#sec-prev}

  The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety(IIHS) published published the results of a study in October 2025 where they used data from 11 states. The states included in the study were Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. There was a range of years covered, but generally the data covers from 2013-2016 up to 2023. 
  
  #include information on the model/methods they used
  
  The results from the IIHS study was that there was an extremely low number of accidents that listed glare from headlights as a contributing factor, and that there was little change between 2015-2023, which was cited as a period where a lot of changes to headlights occurred. They did find, however, that there was a disproportionate impact of glare on accidents involving 70- and 80- year-old drivers [@IIHS_headlights].

## Data {#sec-data}
Will need to introduce data here, discuss limiting factors:

--Combined crashes and parties datasets so we could get age data and all factors that were noted as part of the accident. Original columns of interest prior to cleaning were: "Collision Id", "Crash Date Time", "Day Of Week", "LightingCode", "Primary Collision Factor Violation" from the crashes dataset and "CollisionId", "Other Associate Factor", "StatedAge" from the parties dataset.

Discuss type of merge used, and what factors will now be left out as a result

Turn this into a table:
Final columns in our cleaned dataset were:
prop -> continuous variable, if headlights were listed as one of the factors in this crash. This will be our response variable
elderlyInvolved -> Boolean, if one of the parties in the crash was 70 or older. Used the DMV's age limit before drivers licenses need to be renewed more frequently.
DayofWeek -> Categorical, Day of the Week the accident occured. Included to account for variability in traffic due to the day of the week and commuter patterns.
Month -> Categorical, included to account for variability due to monthly changes in traffic patterns
Year -> Discrete Numerical, 

--some inconsistencies in data noting. Sometimes it was specified if glare/light-based vision obscurement was caused by headlights, but not always. In cases where headlights + head beams weren't specifically noted, we checked the lighting code to confirm if it happened in cases where headlights should be on.

--we also included cases when headlights were not on but it was noted that they should've been. This is still relevant to our case of concern, as the brightness of driving lights + the brightness of other's headlights mean some people drive without headlights and aren't aware that they are off. In this way, headlights being off is still related to the brightness of headlights and a potential link to increased accidents due to brighter headlights. Should be noticed we took care to eliminate any cases caused by "dim headlights".

### Missing Data
There was some missing data. It was handled as follows:
missing data from Age -> assumed not elderly
missing data from LightingCode -> assumed daytime
missing factors -> considered cases where headlights weren't involved

### Limitations of the Data
Only available for 2016-2025, which doesn't cover the introduction of LED headlights. Can only extrapolate conclusions based on increasing deployment of brighter headlights in newer cars. All data is human entered, and has slight inconsistencies depending on usage. Primary concern is that "Vision Obscurement" was listed many times without specifying what was causing the obscurement--could have more cases involving headlights that revealed by our search. We assume that the potential inconsistencies[measurement error?] in reporting have at least remained constant over the 9 years we have data for. One glaring limitation is that due to the size of the datasets, we reduced to just accidents that were recorded to have occurred in lighting that would necessitate headlights being on (Dark, Rainy...). Furthermore, due to the high proportion of days without any accidents with headlights listed as a factor in accidents, we excluded days with no recorded accidents from headlights. Table 1 shows the number of days with no reported accidents from headlights by Year.

Plotting the proportion of accidents where headlights were a listed factor against the year we get @fig-reduced-explore.

![Plot of proportion of headlight accidents against year](./ref/headlight_prop_against_year.jpeg){#fig-reduced-explore}

The line is very flat, which leaves some concern for interpretability, as we are concerned in the trend of the non-zero points.

Attempting a log transform of the proportion and fitting a LOWESS curve forces the zero points to be dropped, but reveals a positive linear trend, shown in @fig-reduced-loess.

![Plot of log(proportion of headlight accidents) against year with a loess curve](./ref/log_headlight_prop_against_year.jpeg){#fig-reduced-loess}

Upon examination of the data, we found that the number of days where no accidents involving headlights was not consistent from year to year, with the exception of 2020-2022, though this is likely due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
@table shows the total of days with and without accidents caused by headlights

2016 - 299
2017 - 300
2018 - 301
2019 - 298
2020 - 312
2021 - 309
2022 - 308
2023 - 298
2024 - 289 #double check last date for 2024 data too
2025 - 282 #data gathered only until--find date
**Need to emphasize that days with no crashes increased over full dataset

@fig-night-zero shows to plot of days without accidents caused by headlights against the year. We can see there is no clear linear trend, so removing the days without accidents will certainly invalidate any results we obtain.

![Plot of number of days without accidents involving headlights against the year](./ref/night_zeroes.jpeg){#fig-night-zero}

Since we will be using a log transform on the data, and our response variable is a proportion, we will proceed by measuring the converse.

## Methods {#sec-methods}

We will be using the model:
$$log(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \hat{\beta_D} * \hat{X_D} + \hat{\beta_M} * \hat{X_M} + \beta_T*X_T + \epsilon_i$$
  For concision, the categorical variables and their coefficients have been represented with vector notation. $Y_i$ represents the proportion of accidents for the day that were not caused by headlights.
  
  $\hat{X_D}$ represents the categorical variables for the day of the week. The default level represents Sunday. $\hat{\beta_D}$ is vector of coefficients for each weekday except Sunday. $\hat{X_M}$ is the vector of categorical variables representing the month of the year. The default level is January. $\hat{\beta_M}$ is the vector of coefficients for each month except January. Both $\hat{\beta_D}$ and $\hat{\beta_M}$ alter the intercept of the model based on the day of the week and the month, respectively. #describe how
    
  $X_T$ is the coefficient representing the year. With all other variables held constant, we expect a unit change in $X_T$ will result in $Y_i$ increasing by a factor of $e^{\beta_T}$. $\epsilon_i$ represents the errors.

We will also need to conduct a hypothesis test to affirm that there is a statistically significant relationship between year and the proportion of car accidents not involving headlights. We will use the null hypothesis $\beta_T = 0$ and alternate hypothesis $\beta_T \not= 0$. We will the test statistic $t^* = \frac{b_T}{s\{b_T\}}$. Using a 95% confidence level, our test statistic will need to be compared with $t(1-\frac{\alpha}{2};n-2) = t(0.975;1549797-19) = `r round(qt(0.975, 1549778),3)`$.


The analysis has been implemented using the R-language [@R_language].

## Other Models {#sec-other}

The IIHS study found that for older drivers, brighter headlights did increase the rate of accidents. As such, we also explored a model that incorporated a categorical variable representing if a participant in the accident was elderly as well as an interaction effect between this variable and the year variable. We defined the cutoff for the elderly category at 70 years old, following when the DMV requires liscences to be renewed more frequently. The model that encorporates the age categorical variable is the following:

$$log(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \hat{\beta_D} * \hat{X_D} + \hat{\beta_M} * \hat{X_M} + \beta_A*X_A + \beta_T*X_T + \beta_{TA}*X_T*X_A + \epsilon_i$$

$X_A$ is the boolean categorical variable representing if someone elderly was involved in the recorded accident. $\beta_A$ represents the change to the intercept if $X_A$ is true. Due to the interaction effect, if someone elderly is involved in the accident the change to $Y_i$ is a factor of $e^{\beta_T + \beta_{TA}}$.

Since we selected our variables prior to building any models, the [what are the variable selection methods by metric called?]. However, the model involving the age categorical variable had a standard error greater than the estimated coefficient for both $X_A$ and $X_T*X_A$. The results are shown in @tbl-age-coeff. 

| $b_A$ | $s(b_A)$ | $b_{TA}$ | $s(b_{TA})$|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|-0.001519|0.003701|0.0000007488|0.000001831|

: Coefficient estimates of $b_A$ and $b_{TA}$ and the standard errors {#tbl-age-coeff}


As the standard error is so large, we cannot reliably make a determination about what effect the age categorical variable has on the proportion of accidents that don't involve headlights.

Further, by comparing the residuals of the two models, we can see that the $X_A$ variable from this dataset does not explain much of the variability. @fig-night-age-resid shows the residuals for this model, which can be compared with @fig-night-resid, which shows the residuals for the model we used. The two plots are fairly similar, aside from the duplicate points in the model with the age categorical variable.


![A plot of the residual against the fitted values for the model that incorporates a variable for age](/ref/night_age_model_resid_against_fitted.jpeg){#fig-night-age-resid}

![A plot of the residual against the fitted values for the model that doesn't incorporate a variable for age](/ref/night_model_resid_against_fitted.jpeg){#fig-night-resid}


## Results {#sec-results}

The results for the model give that $b_T$ is -3.002e-06, with a standard error of 2.916e-07. 

The t-value for this is -10.296. Comparing against our student AAAA. $abs(-10.296) > `r round(qt(0.975, 1549778),3)`$, so we conclude that this may be statistically significant.

However, it is worth noting that the assumptions about errors that are required for the hypothesis test to apply have been broken. The residual graph can be viewed in @fig-night-resid. Our response variable is bound between 0 and 1, meaning the errors can't be normally distributed (?). Additionally, the data points are heavily skewed towards Y_i = 1, which breaks the assumption of constant variance (?).

## Discussion {#sec-discussion}

While our hypothesis test may not be reliable, there are other limitations even if we assume the relationship between Year and the proportion of accidents not involving headlights is accurate. While the negative slope does imply that headlights are causing more accidents in poor lighting, the coefficient is so small that the effect may be negligible. #might want to calculate how many accidents this ends up being for one of the years.

Furthermore, it has been separately noted that there has been an increase in car crashes post-pandemic [@covidCrashes], though we've attempted to limit this by making our response variable the proportion of all accidents that occur in conditions requiring headlights. It is still possible that an increase in car accidents involving headlights may be related to the increase in accidents overall.

Another factor that has already been shown to be resulting in more dangerous car accidents is larger truck size [@IIHS_carSize]. This has also been cited as a cause behind increased headlight glare as well. Larger SUVs and LTVs are more likely to have their headlights at a level where they reflect off the rearview and sideview mirrors of passenger cars [@AAA]. If there is an increase in the number of car accidents involving headlights, it's possible it could be due to the fact that SUVs and LTVs are getting larger rather than more cars having bright headlights.

Finally, there are other factors that could be counteracting the effects of brighter headlights, such as new safety features in cars. These would include features such as Lane Keep Assist, but also automatic headlights.
